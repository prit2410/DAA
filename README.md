Implement: Solution: DAA Hands On 2/SortingAlgorithm.py

1. insertion sort

2. selection sort

3. bubble sort

 

In the discussion:

1. Post a link to your github repository(s) with the source code.

2. Argue selection sort correctness. Solution: DAA Hands On 2/Correctness of Selection Sort.pdf

3. Benchmark the runtime of each algorithm. Your benchmarks should include information about your computer (ram, cpu etc.) and be run with various input sizes;
from small (array of size 5,10,20) all the way up to large arrays (where your computer is struggling). I should at the very least see a plot of time vs input size n. Feel free to use benchmarking software.

3. DAA Hands On 2/Benchmark.py & DAA Hands On 2/SortingPerformanceResults.xlsx
