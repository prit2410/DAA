1. Implement both versions of quicksort (random and non-random choice for the pivot) and share the GitHub repository with your source code.
Solution: QuickSort.py

2.  For the non-random pivot version of quicksort show the following benchmarks on the same graph:

    2a) best case (generate a set of inputs that will always be the best case, repeat for multiple array input sizes "n").

    2b) worst case (generate a set of inputs that will always be the worst case, repeat for multiple array input sizes "n").

    2c) average case (generate a set of inputs from a uniform distribution, repeat for multiple array input sizes "n").

3. Mathematically derive the average runtime complexity of the non-random pivot version of quicksort.
